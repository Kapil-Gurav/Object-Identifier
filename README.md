Developed and implemented an object detection project using Python and TensorFlow's Object Detection API. Utilized deep learning techniques to train a custom object detection model capable of identifying and localizing objects within images. Integrated the model into a Python application for real-time inference, achieving accurate detection results with high precision. Demonstrated proficiency in machine learning, computer vision, and software development, while effectively applying technical skills to solve complex problems and deliver innovative solutions.


Data Collection:
Gather a dataset of images or videos containing the objects you want to detect. Ensure that the dataset is diverse and representative of real-world scenarios.
Preprocessing:
Preprocess the dataset as needed. This may include resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and annotating images with bounding boxes that indicate the location of objects.
Choose a Detection Model:
Select a pre-trained object detection model suitable for your task. Popular choices include Faster R-CNN, SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector), YOLO (You Only Look Once), and Mask R-CNN.
Model Training (Optional):
If you have a large dataset or need to detect custom objects, fine-tune the chosen model on your dataset. Alternatively, you can skip this step and use a pre-trained model if your dataset is small or similar to the original training data.
Model Integration:
Integrate the trained or pre-trained model into your Python project. You can use deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, along with their respective object detection APIs (TensorFlow Object Detection API or detectron2).
Inference:
Write code to perform inference on new images or video streams using the trained model. This involves loading the model, preprocessing input data, running inference, and post-processing the detection results (e.g., filtering detections, drawing bounding boxes).
Visualization:
Visualize the detection results by overlaying bounding boxes on the input images or videos. This helps verify the performance of the model and understand its predictions.
Evaluation (Optional):
Evaluate the performance of your object detection model using metrics such as precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP). This step is crucial for assessing the model's accuracy and identifying areas for improvement.
Deployment (Optional):
Deploy the object detection model as part of a larger application or system. This may involve creating a web-based interface, integrating with other software components, or deploying to edge devices for real-time inference.
Continuous Improvement:
Continuously monitor and update the object detection model to adapt to changes in the environment, improve accuracy, and address new use cases or challenges.
Here's a basic example using TensorFlow's Object Detection API for detecting objects in images:

1st iteration of project python code (this will vary from actual code) 

import tensorflow as tf
from object_detection.utils import label_map_util
from object_detection.utils import visualization_utils as viz_utils
import cv2

# Load the trained object detection model
model = tf.saved_model.load('path/to/saved_model')

# Load label map
category_index = label_map_util.create_category_index_from_labelmap('path/to/label_map.pbtxt', use_display_name=True)

# Load and preprocess input image
image = cv2.imread('path/to/input_image.jpg')
image_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
image_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(image_rgb)
image_tensor = tf.expand_dims(image_tensor, 0)

# Run inference
detections = model(image_tensor)

# Visualize detection results
viz_utils.visualize_boxes_and_labels_on_image_array(
    image,
    detections['detection_boxes'][0].numpy(),
    detections['detection_classes'][0].numpy().astype(int),
    detections['detection_scores'][0].numpy(),
    category_index,
    use_normalized_coordinates=True,
    max_boxes_to_draw=200,
    min_score_thresh=0.30,
    agnostic_mode=False)

# Display the annotated image
cv2.imshow('Object Detection', cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR))
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
Remember to replace 'path/to/saved_model', 'path/to/label_map.pbtxt', and 'path/to/input_image.jpg' with the appropriate paths in your system. This example assumes you have already trained or downloaded a pre-trained object detection model and have a label map file defining the classes you want to detect.
